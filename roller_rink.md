My plan is to take the Gym app brief and reskin it as a roller rink.

I won't be making any major changes to the brief, but Member will become Skater and Class will become Lesson.

To allow the many-to-many relationship for these two classes and their respective tables, I'll also create a class called Level which will hold the attributes of skater, lesson and level (beginner, intermediate, etc.)

The attirbutes for my Skater class will be minimal at first, with an option to add more later. These will be name and membbership (standard or premium), the latter of which I'll include to make things easier IF I decide to tackle the associated extension tasks.

So, adapting the stated MVP to my take on it, I've outlined MY MVP as the following:

On my app, it should be possible to:
1. add (create) and edit skaters, as well as lessons.
2. book individual skaters into lessons.
3. view a list of all upcoming lessons.
4. view all skaters booked for a particular lesson.
